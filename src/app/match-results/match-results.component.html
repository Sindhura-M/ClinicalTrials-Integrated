		<h4> Your personalized list of preliminary clinical trials is ready to view</h4>
        <p>We recommend you share and review the following results with your clinician before you submit an application for a clinical trial. They will be able to provide you with more detailed feedback and recommendations for the right trial to apply for.</p>

        <p>When you submit an application it will be reviewed by the medical team hosting the clinical trial. You might be required to do further testing to meet additional eligibility criteria.</p>

        <p>We also recommend you update your profile page as your condition changes, or if you have received additional treatments. You can sign up to notifications to be informed when new trials are uploaded to the site.</p>
